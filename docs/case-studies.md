# Case Studies

Each completed simulation is documented as a case study with full problem setup, methodology, results, and validation.

---

## Coming Soon

Case studies will be added as simulations are completed during the 9-week program (Feb 23 – Apr 19, 2026).

### Planned Analyses

**Structural (ME3601)**
- 2D plate with hole — stress concentration and mesh convergence
- Euler buckling column — critical load validation
- Welded fillet joint — static strength vs. Shigley
- Welded shaft under combined loading
- Fatigue life prediction on welded bracket

**Vibrations (ME440)**
- Single-DOF oscillator — natural frequency validation
- Multi-DOF modal analysis — eigenvalue comparison with MATLAB
- Harmonic response sweep with damping
- Vibration absorber design and validation

**Thermal-Fluid (ME379)**
- 1D conduction in rod — Fourier's law validation
- Convection on heated surface — Newton's law of cooling
- Laminar pipe flow (Fluent) — Hagen-Poiseuille validation
- Flat plate boundary layer — Blasius solution comparison
- Coupled thermal-structural — thermal stress validation

*Each case study will include: problem description, model setup, mesh convergence, hand calculation, ANSYS results, error analysis, and lessons learned.*
