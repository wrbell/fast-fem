# About This Project

Fast-FEM is a compressed 9-week self-study program for mastering Finite Element Analysis and ANSYS simulation software. It was designed to support three concurrent University of Michigan mechanical engineering courses while building a portfolio of validated engineering simulations.

## Author

**Willem Bell** — Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan

## Goals

1. Go from zero ANSYS experience to validated multi-physics simulations
2. Deliver three course projects with FEA methodology sections
3. Build a portfolio demonstrating engineering judgment, not just software proficiency

## What Makes This Different

Most FEA portfolios show colorful contour plots. This one shows the work behind them:

- **Every result is validated** against analytical hand calculations
- **Mesh convergence studies** demonstrate numerical rigor
- **Post-mortems** document what went wrong and what was learned
- **Methodology is explicit** — the V&V process is documented and repeatable

## Technical Stack

| Component | Tool |
|-----------|------|
| FEA Solver | ANSYS Student Edition (Mechanical) |
| CFD Solver | ANSYS Fluent (CPU, 4-5 cores) |
| Hand Calculations | Python / Jupyter Notebooks |
| Convergence Plots | matplotlib |
| Documentation | Markdown, GitHub Pages |
| Version Control | Git / GitHub |

## Schedule

The program runs from **February 23 to April 19, 2026**, with a buffer week before the April 27 project deadline. Spring break is used as a theory sprint to front-load reading for hands-on weeks.
