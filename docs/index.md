# Fast-FEM: Accelerated FEA Portfolio

Self-directed mastery of Finite Element Method theory and ANSYS simulation, built to support three concurrent mechanical engineering course projects at the University of Michigan.

## Course Projects

| Course | Focus | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **ME3601** — Machine Elements | Static/fatigue analysis, welded joints, shafts | TBD |
| **ME440** — Vibrations | Modal analysis, forced response, absorber design | TBD |
| **ME379** — Thermal-Fluid | Convection, boundary layers, coupled thermal | TBD |

All projects due **April 27, 2026**.

## Approach

Every simulation follows a rigorous [verification & validation methodology](methodology):

1. **Hand calculation first** — compute the expected answer analytically
2. **Build the FEA model** — geometry, mesh, BCs, material, solver
3. **Compare** — quantify error between FEA and analytical
4. **Document** — validation report with full setup, results, and lessons

## Case Studies

As simulations are completed, they'll appear in the [Case Studies](case-studies) section with full validation reports, convergence studies, and contour plots.

## Tools & Hardware

- **Software:** ANSYS Student Edition (Mechanical, Fluent, DesignXplorer)
- **Theory:** Hughes (FEM), Shigley (design), Inman (vibrations), Cengel (heat transfer)
- **Hardware:** Dell Precision 5860 — Xeon W3-2425, 64GB DDR5, RTX 2000 Ada
- **Validation:** Python/Jupyter notebooks for automated hand-calc comparison
