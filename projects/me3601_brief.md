# ME3601 — Machine Elements: Project Brief

**Status:** TBD — fill in when project is assigned
**Due:** Apr 27, 2026
**Instructor:** Prof. Ruiz (office hours Tue/Thu)

---

## Objective

*What engineering question is this project answering?*

> (e.g., "Design and validate a welded shaft assembly for a gearbox under combined loading")

## Component / Geometry

*What are you modeling? Sketch or describe the part.*

- Part description:
- Key dimensions:
- Material(s):
- CAD source: (SOLIDWORKS / ANSYS SpaceClaim / provided by instructor)

## Analysis Type

*Check all that apply:*

- [ ] Static structural (linear)
- [ ] Buckling
- [ ] Fatigue (S-N approach)
- [ ] Nonlinear (plasticity, large deformation)
- [ ] Contact (bolted/welded joints, gear mesh)
- [ ] Other:

## Boundary Conditions & Loads

| BC / Load | Type | Value | Location |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Weld Details (if applicable)

- Weld type: (fillet / butt / groove)
- Weld size:
- Modeling approach: (bonded contact / shell weld / solid weld geometry)
- Fatigue method: (nominal stress / hot-spot / notch stress per IIW)

## Validation Plan

| Result | Hand Calc Formula | Expected Value | ANSYS Target Error |
|--------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| | | | < 5% |
| | | | < 5% |

*Reference: validation.md for formula lookup*

## Deliverables

- [ ] ANSYS model file (.wbpj)
- [ ] Validation report (use templates/validation_report.md)
- [ ] Stress contour screenshots
- [ ] Mesh convergence plot
- [ ] Written report section on FEA methodology
- [ ] Other:

## Schedule Alignment

*Which canonical schedule weeks does this project draw from?*

- Week 1: Static analysis, weld intro
- Week 3: Fatigue
- Week 4: Beams/shells, welded shafts
- Week 7: Advanced fatigue, nonlinear
- Week 8: Capstone integration

## Notes

*Design decisions, instructor guidance, constraints, etc.*
