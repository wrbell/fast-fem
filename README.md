# Fast-FEM
Learning to Ansys quickly to support 3x semester projects

## Goals
- Understand theory enough to have a working understanding to develop off of
- 1D/2D/3D mesh successfully
- Solve implicit & explicit dynamics

## Future desires
- Advanced Solvers (LS-Dyna, ANSYS)
- Advanced Pre-Processors (Hypermesh, ANSA)
- Advanced Post-Processors (META?)
